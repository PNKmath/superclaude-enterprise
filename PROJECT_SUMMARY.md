### 3. **Gemini CLI Integration with Context Preservation**
- ✅ Automatic backend selection between Claude and Gemini
- ✅ Cost estimation and tracking
- ✅ Smart routing based on context size and file count
- ✅ 50% API cost reduction for large contexts
- ✅ Quota management with daily limits
- ✅ **3-Mode Context Preservation System** (v1.3.0)
  - Template Mode (80%): Structured outputs for consistent results
  - Adaptive Mode (15%): Dynamic context preservation for complex tasks
  - Hybrid Mode (5%): Pattern-based work with flexibility
- ✅ Automatic strategy selection based on complexity scoring
- ✅ Session continuity and validation system
- ✅ 95%+ context preservation rate

### 4. **5-Level Execution Control**
- ✅ Level 0 (Silent) - Execute without output
- ✅ Level 1 (Summary) - Show summary only
- ✅ Level 2 (Detail) - Show detailed plan
- ✅ Level 3 (Confirm) - Require user confirmation
- ✅ Level 4 (Auto-block) - Block dangerous operations
- ✅ Automatic level determination based on context

### 5. **Advanced Hook System (Claude Code Hooks)**
- ✅ Full Claude Code hooks integration
- ✅ PreToolUse hooks for validation and blocking
- ✅ PostToolUse hooks for auto-formatting and testing
- ✅ Notification hooks for custom alerts
- ✅ Stop hooks for completion validation
- ✅ Multi-source configuration (user/project/local)
- ✅ Environment variable support
- ✅ Parallel execution and background hooks
- ✅ Integration with SuperClaude without core modifications

### 6. **Learning Engine**
- ✅ Pattern recognition from usage
- ✅ Privacy-preserving local storage
- ✅ Team and personal insights
- ✅ Productivity scoring

### 7. **Security Layer**
- ✅ Automatic credential masking
- ✅ Audit trail generation
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Blocked command patterns
