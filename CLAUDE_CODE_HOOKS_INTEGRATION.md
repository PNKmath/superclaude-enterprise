# Claude Code Hooks Integration Summary

## What Was Completed

### 1. ✅ Full Claude Code Hook System Implementation
- Created comprehensive `HookManager` class supporting all Claude Code hook types
- Implemented PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Notification, Stop, and SubagentStop hooks
- Added environment variable support for passing context to hooks
- Implemented parallel execution, background hooks, and timeout management

### 2. ✅ Hook Configuration Structure
- Created `.claude/settings.json` with default enterprise hooks
- Added `.claude/settings.local.json.template` for personal customization
- Created example hook configurations in `.claude/hooks/`:
  - `python-project.json` - Python development hooks
  - `typescript-project.json` - TypeScript/JavaScript hooks  
  - `security-focused.json` - Security enforcement hooks
  - `team-collaboration.json` - Team workflow hooks

### 3. ✅ Default Enterprise Hooks
The system includes pre-configured hooks for:
- **Security**: Blocks dangerous commands (rm -rf), sensitive file access
- **Auto-formatting**: Python (black, ruff), TypeScript (prettier, eslint)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic persona conflict checking
- **Testing**: Runs tests on relevant file changes
- **Notifications**: Logs all Claude notifications

### 4. ✅ CLI Commands for Hook Management
Added new commands to the CLI:
- `superclaude-enterprise hooks` - View active hooks
- `superclaude-enterprise check-veto` - Check persona veto conditions
- `superclaude-enterprise conflict-check` - Check for file edit conflicts
- `superclaude-enterprise log-notification` - Log notifications
- `superclaude-enterprise validate-completion` - Validate before stopping

### 5. ✅ Installation Script Updates
Enhanced `install-enterprise.sh` to:
- Create `.claude` directory structure
- Set up default hook configurations
- Copy hook templates
- Create user hooks directory

### 6. ✅ Comprehensive Documentation
- Created `HOOKS.md` - Quick reference guide
- Created `docs/HOOKS.md` - Full documentation with examples
- Updated `README.md` with hooks section
- Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` with hook system details
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with hook features

### 7. ✅ Integration Tests
Added comprehensive test suite for hooks:
- Hook loading and configuration
- PreToolUse blocking behavior
- PostToolUse execution
- Environment variable passing
- Background execution
- Error handling and timeouts
- Enterprise-specific features

### 8. ✅ Integration with Existing Systems
- Hooks integrated with ConflictResolver
- ExtensionManager executes hooks at key points
- Hook results can trigger persona vetoes
- Hook execution respects execution levels

## Key Features Implemented

### Multi-Source Configuration
Hooks load from multiple sources in priority order:
1. User global: `~/.claude/settings.json`
2. Project: `.claude/settings.json`
3. Local project: `.claude/settings.local.json` (git-ignored)

### Exit Code Control
- Exit code 0: Success
- Exit code 1: Failure (logged but continues)
- Exit code 2: Special control (blocks PreToolUse, forces continuation on Stop)

### Environment Variables
Hooks receive rich context through environment variables:
- `$CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS` - Affected files
- `$CLAUDE_TOOL_NAME` - Tool being used
- `$CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT` - Tool input
- `$CLAUDE_TOOL_RESPONSE` - Tool output
- `$CLAUDE_NOTIFICATION` - Notification message
- `$SUPERCLAUDE_PERSONAS` - Active personas
- `$SUPERCLAUDE_COMMAND` - Current command

## Test Results
All 36 tests passing, including:
- 11 original ConflictResolver tests
- 9 SuperClaude integration tests
- 16 new hook integration tests

## Usage Example

```bash
# View active hooks
superclaude-enterprise hooks

# Test a dangerous command
superclaude-enterprise check-veto security --command "rm -rf /"

# Check for conflicts
superclaude-enterprise conflict-check --files "api.ts db.ts" --personas "architect,performance"
```

## Next Steps
The Claude Code hooks are now fully integrated and ready for use. Users can:
1. Customize hooks in `.claude/settings.json`
2. Add personal hooks in `.claude/settings.local.json`
3. Use example configurations from `.claude/hooks/`
4. Create team-specific hook configurations

This integration provides deterministic automation alongside AI assistance, ensuring critical tasks always execute while maintaining the flexibility of LLM-driven development.
