print("1. Understanding SuperClaude Architecture:")
print("   - SuperClaude is NOT an external executable")
print("   - It's a Claude Code slash command system")
print("   - Commands like /analyze, /build are Claude Code commands")
print("   - They are executed INSIDE Claude Code, not via Python")

print("\n2. What the Bridge Actually Does:")
print("   ✓ Converts natural language to slash commands")
print("   ✓ Maps user intent to appropriate /sc: commands")
print("   ✓ Suggests personas based on context")
print("   ✓ Returns structured command for Claude Code")

print("   - Receives natural language from Claude Code")
print("   - Uses SuperClaudeBridge to convert to commands")
print("   - Returns structured command data")
print("   - Claude Code executes the actual slash command")

print("\n6. Python Detection Purpose:")
print("   - NOT for executing SuperClaude commands")
print("   - For potential pre/post processing scripts")
print("   - For validation and environment checks")
print("   - For future extensions that might need Python")

print("\n✅ Bridge is Working Correctly If:")
print("   - Natural language → slash command conversion works")
print("   - MCP server responds to Claude Code requests")
print("   - Commands are executed inside Claude Code")
print("   - No external Python execution of slash commands")

print("\n❌ Common Misconceptions:")
print("   - 'python -m SuperClaude analyze' is NOT how it works")
print("   - SuperClaude commands are NOT Python scripts")
print("   - Bridge does NOT execute commands, only converts them")
